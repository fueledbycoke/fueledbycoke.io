                <p>Demon's Souls is a 2020 action role-playing game developed by Bluepoint Games and published by Sony
                    Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 5. The game was released as a launch title for the
                    PlayStation 5 in November. It is a remake of Demon's Souls, originally developed by FromSoftware for
                    the PlayStation 3 in 2009. Japan Studio assisted on its development, which makes Demonâ€™s Souls its
                    last game before its merger with Team Asobi. Demon's Souls received critical acclaim from critics,
                    who praised its gameplay, visuals, technical aspects, and improvements over the original game. It
                    sold over 1.4 million copies by September 2021.

                    Demon's Souls is set in Boletaria, a kingdom consumed by a dark being called the Old One, following
                    its release through the use of forbidden Soul Arts. Players take on the role of a hero brought to
                    Boletaria to kill its fallen king Allant and pacify the Old One.</p>

                <p>Bloodborne[b] is a 2015 action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Sony
                    Computer
                    Entertainment for the PlayStation 4. Bloodborne follows the player's character, a Hunter, through
                    the
                    decrepit Gothic, Victorian-eraâ€“inspired city of Yharnam, whose inhabitants are afflicted with a
                    blood-borne
                    disease which transforms the residents, called Yharnamites, into horrific beasts. Attempting to find
                    the
                    source of the plague, the player's character unravels the city's mysteries while fighting beasts and
                    cosmic
                    beings.

                    The game is played from a third-person perspective. Players control a customizable protagonist, and
                    the
                    gameplay is focused on strategic weapons-based combat and exploration. Players battle varied enemies
                    while
                    using items such as trick weapons and firearms, exploring different locations, interacting with
                    non-player
                    characters, and unraveling the city's mysteries. Bloodborne began development in 2012 under the
                    working
                    title of Project Beast. Bearing many similarities to FromSoftware's Dark Souls series, Bloodborne
                    was
                    inspired by the literary works of authors H. P. Lovecraft and Bram Stoker and the architectural
                    design of
                    real-world locations in countries such as Romania and Czechia.

                <p>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice[a] is a 2019 action-adventure game developed by FromSoftware. It was
                    released for
                    PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in March 2019 and for Stadia in October 2020 by FromSoftware in
                    Japan
                    and Activision internationally. The game follows a shinobi known as Wolf, who attempts to take
                    revenge on a
                    samurai clan that imprisoned him and kidnapped his lord. The gameplay is focused on stealth,
                    exploration,
                    and combat, with a particular emphasis on boss battles. It takes place in a fictionalized Japan
                    during the
                    Sengoku period and makes strong references to Buddhist mythology and philosophy.

                    Lead director Hidetaka Miyazaki wanted to create a new intellectual property (IP) that marked a
                    departure
                    from their Dark Souls series, looking at games such as Tenchu for inspiration. Sekiro was praised by
                    critics, who complimented its gameplay and setting, and compared it to Dark Souls, although opinions
                    on its
                    difficulty were mixed. It won several year-end awards and sold over five million copies by July
                    2020.</p>

                <p>Elden Ring[a] is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware. It was directed by
                    Hidetaka
                    Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was released for
                    PlayStation
                    4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and
                    Bandai
                    Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a
                    quest to
                    repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.

                    Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open
                    world.
                    The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of
                    travel.
                    Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of
                    weapons and
                    magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's
                    world,
                    checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game
                    currency
                    called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for
                    cooperative
                    and player-versus-player combat.
